# Build Your Own Student Loan Repayment Predictor

Welcome to the **Student Loan Repayment Prediction** project! This project focuses on using deep learning techniques to predict whether a borrower will repay their student loans. The neural network model leverages historical borrower data to improve loan offerings and mitigate default risks.

## Introduction
Student loan refinancing institutions often rely on credit scores and borrower data to determine loan eligibility and interest rates. This project enhances that process by building a neural network model that predicts loan repayment likelihood. By analyzing datasets of past student borrowers, the model identifies trends and predicts potential repayment outcomes, allowing institutions to offer personalized interest rates.

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**  
   - Load the student loan dataset (CSV format).  
   - Preprocess the data by scaling features and encoding target variables.  
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.  

2. **Neural Network Construction**  
   - Design a deep neural network using TensorFlow and Keras.  
   - Train the model on borrower data with two hidden layers and relu activation functions.  
   - Evaluate the model’s performance using accuracy and loss metrics.  

3. **Prediction and Evaluation**  
   - Use the trained model to predict loan repayment likelihood on test data.  
   - Generate binary predictions and evaluate using a classification report.  

4. **Recommendation System (Bonus)**  
   - Develop a loan recommendation system based on borrower profiles and loan attributes.  
   - Implement content-based filtering to match loan products with student needs.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** – Programming language for model development and data processing.  
- **TensorFlow/Keras** – Deep learning framework used to build and train the neural network.  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and preprocessing.  
- **Scikit-Learn** – Tools for data splitting, scaling, and evaluation.  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive environment for developing and testing the model.  
- **Matplotlib** – Visualization of model accuracy and loss over training epochs.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:  
- **Python 3.10+**  
- **Anaconda (Optional for Virtual Environment Management)**  
- **Git**  

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/neural-network-challenge-1.git
   cd neural-network-challenge-1
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**  
   ```bash
   conda create -n ai_loan_env python=3.10 anaconda
   conda activate ai_loan_env
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow keras scikit-learn pandas matplotlib
   ```

---

## Usage
1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Run the Notebook**  
   - Open `student_loans_with_deep_learning.ipynb` and execute each cell step by step.  
   - The notebook covers data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.  
   - After training, predictions are generated and displayed.  

3. **Model Export**  
   - The trained model is saved as `student_loans.keras`.  
   - You can reload the model later for predictions or further training.
